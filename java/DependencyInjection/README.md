## Inversion of Control Containers and the Dependency Injection Pattern
Source: Martin Fowler
In the Java community there's been a rush of lightweight containers that help to assemble components from different projects into a cohesive application.
Underlying these containers is a common pattern to how they perform the wiring, a concept they refer under the very generic name of "Inversion of Control";
In this article the more specific name of "Dependency Injection", and contrast it with the Service Locator alternative.
The choice between them is less important than the principle of separating configuration from use.

One of the entertaining things about the enterprise java world is the huge amount of activity in building alternatives to the mainstream J2EE technologies, much of it happening in open source.
A lot of this is a reaction to the heavyweight complexity in the mainstream J2EE world, but much of it is also exploring alternatives and coming up with creative ideas.
A common issue to deal with is how to wire together different elements: how do you fit together this web controller architecture with that database interface backing when they were built by different teams with little knowledge of each other.
A number of frameworks have taken a stab at this problem, and several are branching out to provide a general capability to assemble components from different layers.
These are often referred to as lightweight containers, examples include PicoContainer, and Spring.

Underlying these containers are a number of interesting design principles, things that go beyond both these specific containers and indeed the Java platform.
Here I want to start exploring some of these principles.

## Components and Services
The topic of wiring elements together drags me almost immediately into the knotty terminology problems that surround the terms service and component.
You find long and contradictory articles on the definition of these things with ease.

I use component to mean a glob of software that's intended to be used, without change, by an application that is out of control of the writers of the component.
By 'without change' I mean that the using applicaiton doesn't change the source code of hte components, although they may alter the component's behavior by extending it in ways allowed by the component writers.

A service is similar to a component in that it's used by foreign applicaitons. The main difference is that I expect a component to be used locally (think jar file, assembly, dll, or a source import);
A service will be used remotely through some remote interface, either synchronous or asynchronous (eg web service, messaging system, RPC, or socket);

## A Naive Example
In this example I am writing a component that provides a list of movies directed by a particular director.
This stunningly useful function is implemented by a single method.
```
class MovieLister...
    public Movie[] moviesDirectedBy(String arg) {
        List allMovies = finder.findAll();
        for (Iterator it = allMovies.iterator(); it.hasNext();) {
            Movie movie = (Movie) it.next();
            if (!movie.getDirector().equals(arg)) it.remove();
        }
        return (Movie[]) allMovies.toArray(new Movie[allMovies.size()]);
    }

```
This function asks a finder object (which we will get to in a moment) to return every film it knows about. Then it just hunts through this list to return those directed by a particular director.

The real point of this article is this finder object, or particularly how we connect the lister object with a particular finder object.
The reason why this is interesting is that I want my wonderful moviesDirectedBy method to be completely independent of how all the movies are being stored.
I can bring this out by defining an interface for the finder.
```
public interface MovieFinder{
    List findAll();
}
```
Now all of this is very well decoupled. But at some point I have to come up with a concrete class to actually come up with the movies.
In this case I put the code for this in the constructor of my lister class.
```
class MovieLister..
    private MovieFinder finder;
    public MovieLister() {
        finder = new ColonDelimitedMovieFinder("movies1.txt");
    }
 ```
Now if I am using this class for just myself, this is all fine and dandy.
But what happens when my friends are overwhelmed by a desire for this wonderful functionality and would like a copy of my program?
What if they have a completely different form of storing their movie listing: a SQL database, an XML file, a web service, or just another format of text file?
Now because I've defined a MovieFinder interface, this won't alter my moviesDirectedBy method. But I still need to have some way to get an instance of the right finder implentation into place.

The MovieLister class is dependent on both the MovieFinder interface and upon the implementation.
We would prefer it if it were only dependent on the interface, but then how do we make an instance to work with?

In his book: P of EAA, this situation is described as a Plugin. The implementation class for the finder isn't linked into the program at compile time, since I don't know what my friends are going to use.
Instead we want my lister to work with any implementation, and for that implementation to be plugged in at some later point, out of my hands.
  The problem is how can I make that link so that my lister class is ignorant of hte implementation class, but can still talk to an instance to do its work.

Expanding this into a real system, we might have dozens of such services and components. In each case we can abstract our use of these components by talking to them through an interface (and using an adapter if the component isn't designed with an interface in mind).
But if we wish to deploy this system in different ways, we nee to use plugins to handle the interaction with these services so we can use different implementations in different deployments.

So the core problem is how do we assemble these plugins into an application? This is one of the main problems that this new breed of lightweight containers face, and universally they all do it using Inversion of Control.

## Inversion of Control
When these containers talk about how they are so useful because they implement "Inversion of Control" I end up very puzzled.
Inversion of control is a common characteristic of frameworks, so saying that these lightweight container are special because they use inversion of control is like saying my car is special because they have wheels.

The question is: "What aspect of control are they inverting?" When I first ran into inversion of control, it was in the main control of a user interface.
Early user interface were controlled by the application program. You would have a sequence of commands like "Enter name", 
"enter address"; your program would drive the prompts and pick up a response to each one. With graphical UIs the UI framework would contain this main loop and your program instead provided event handlers for the various
fields on the screen. The main control of the program was inverted, moved away from you to the framework.

For this new breed of containers the inversion is about how they lookup a plugin implementation. 
In my naive example the lister looked up the finder implementation by directly instantiating it.
This stops the finder from being a plugin. The approach that these containers use is to ensure that any user of a plugin follows
some convention that allows a separate assembler module to inject the implementation into the lister.

As a result I think we need a more specific name for this pattern. Inversion of Control 
is too generic a term, and thus people find it confusing. As a result with a lot of discussion
with various IoC advocates we settled on the name Dependency Injection.

I am going to start by talking about the various forms of dependency injection, but I'll
point out now that that's not the only way of removing the dependency from the application 
class to the plugin implementation. The other pattern you can use to do this is Service Locator.

## Forms of Dependency Injection
The basic idea of the Dependency injection is to have a separate object, an assembler,
that populates a field in the lister class with an appropriate implementation for the finder
interface, resulting in a dependency diagram along the lines of Figure 2.
There are three main styles of dependency injection. The names I am using for them
are Constructor Injection, Setter Injection, and interface injection. If you read
about this stuff in the current discussions about Inversion of Control you will hear 
these referred to as type 1 IoC (interface injection), type 2 IoC (setter injection) and
type 3 IoC (constructor injection). I find numeric names rather hard to remember, which is why
I've used the names I have here.

## Constructor Injection with PicoContainer
I will start with showing how this injection is done using a lightweight container called PioContainer.
I am starting here primarily because several of my colleagues at ThoughtWorks are very 
active in the developement of PicoContainer.

PicoContainer uses a constructor to decide how to inject a finder implementation 
into the lister class. For this to work, the movie lister class needs to declare a 
constructor that includes everything it needs injected.
```aidl
public MovieLister(MovieFinder finder) {
        this.finder = finder;
    }
```
The finder itself will also be manged by the pico container, and as such will have the 
filename of the text file injected into it by the container.
```aidl
public class ColonMovieFinder {
    String filename;
    public ColonMovieFinder(String filename){
        this.filename = filename;
    }
}
```
The pico container then needs to be told which implementation class
to associate with each interface, and which string to inject into the finder.
private MutablePicoContainer configureContainer() {
