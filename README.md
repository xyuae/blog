## Note
Hash Map is a Hash table based implementaion of the Map interface. It does not guarantee that the order will remain constant over time.
HashMap has two important factor: capacity and load factor
Initial capacity is the number of buckets in the hash table
Load factor is a measure of how full the hash table is allowed to get before its capacity is automatically increased
work flow of put: hashCode(key) -> index = hashCode % capacity -> store in Map[index], when collision, store in the beginning of the linkedList. 
-> if  len(linkedList) > Terrify_THRESHOLD, store in black-and red tree
