## List, Set and Map
The Collection framework in Java is a common interview Question
- List can have repetitive object. It is ordered. Every element has an index
- Set can't have repetitive object
- Map has key value pair

A better way to answer is:
- List, Set and Map are interfaces. List and Set inherit Collection Interface, Map is a stand-alone interface
- Set has HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
- List has ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList
- Map has Hashtable, LinkedHashMap, HashMap, TreeMap
